# Machine Learning Project - Task 1

This project involves a machine learning task implemented in a Jupyter Notebook (`Task1.ipynb`) and utilizes two datasets: `tested.csv` and `tested_scaled.csv`. The main goal appears to be analyzing or predicting data based on preprocessing and model training.

## 📁 Files Overview

- **Task1.ipynb**: The main Jupyter Notebook containing all code, including data loading, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- **tested.csv**: Raw or partially processed dataset used as input to the notebook.
- **tested_scaled.csv**: Scaled or normalized version of `tested.csv`, possibly used for training/testing models.

## ⚙️ Requirements

Make sure the following Python packages are installed:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
